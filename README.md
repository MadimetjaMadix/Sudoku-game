## About Sudoku

Every sudoku puzzle involves a 9×9 grid of squares subdivided into 3×3 boxes.

In total there are 81 squares on a sudoku grid and when the puzzle is completed each square will contain exactly one number.

## Rules
Sudoku is a puzzle based on a small number of very simple rules:

- Every square has to contain a single number
- Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be used
- Each 3×3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
- Each vertical column can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
- Each horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
- Once the puzzle is solved, this means that every row, column, and 3×3 box will contain every number from 1 to 9 exactly once.

In other words, no number can be repeated in any 3×3 box, row, or column.

## Buttons and Modes
